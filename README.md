# Content-Aware-Dynamic-Quantization-for-Image-Super-Resolution
The overview of the proposed quantization framework CADyQ for SR network, which we illustrate with a residual block based backbone. For each given patch and each layer, our CADyQ module introduces a light-weight bit selector that dynamically selects the bit-width and its corresponding quantization function  among the candidate quantization functions with distinct bit-widths.
